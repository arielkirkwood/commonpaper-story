# commonpaper-story
My submission for the Common Paper engineering candidate assessment.

## Setup
To run the applications in this repo, you'll need to have Ruby 3.0 installed.

With Ruby installed, you should have access to Bundler via `bundle`; execute `bundle` to install the dependencies for this project.

## Running the application
From there, you can `generate` a story passing escaped JSON wrapped in double quotes to the `bin/story` executable:
```
bin/story generate "{\"number\": 2, \"unit_of_measure\": \"mile\", \"place\": \"school\", \"adjective\": \"blue\", \"noun\": \"rock\"}"`
```

Statistics coming next!
